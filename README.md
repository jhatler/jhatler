# Hey there, I'm Jaremy! This is where I write code and prosper. 🖖

I'm a DevOps practitioner and student of technology in all its forms. There are few things I enjoy more than learning
and exploring new systems to see what lessons I can glean to share with others. Over the years, I've learned
that transforming and adapting complex systems isn't just about code or technology — it's about inspiring your fellow
humans to go on a journey of learning together, to feel excited about making everyone's day go a little smoother.

Here, I share my journey, my experiments with code, and the occasional insight on how a small tweak can make a big
difference. I hope you find something useful, or at least entertaining, in my work. Feel free to reach out!

## Cryptography

Because of my work in security and the amount of access I generally have to sensitive data, I take my personal
operational security very seriously. Below you'll find a link to my trust chain containing my PGP, SMIME, and other
public keys. I've also included a link to my Keybase profile, which is a great way to verify my identity and
pull my keys from a trusted source.

Unless otherwise noted or discussed, if you receive a communication from me that isn't signed in some way you should
consider it to be untrusted and reach out to me directly to verify its authenticity.

## Projects

- **[JANUS](https://github.com/jhatler/janus):** Internal Development Platform (IDP) targeting complex multi‑cloud environments like AI/ML workloads, IoT Device Management, OS distribution
  and support, etc.
  - Core Tech:
    - Spacelift
    - Ansible
    - Terraform
    - Packer
    - Docker
    - Devcontainers
    - GitHub Actions/Codespaces
    - Aikido
    - Codacy
    - Infracost
  - Supports Ubuntu 8.04.4 and up to aid in migration of legacy systems to modern platforms.
- In my pins, you'll find various repos related to my Gentoo use, including a few overlays.
  These are unpolished at the moment, but I'm in the process of incorporating a large amount
  of out-of-band work I've done to produce a full-fledged, security-focused Linux distribution.
  It's my daily driver but hic sunt dracones until I get the infrastructure in place to support
  others. Stay tuned for more updates on that!
