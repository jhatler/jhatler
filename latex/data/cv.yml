  summary: |
    Driven technology leader adept at end-to-end modernization, migrating legacy environments to agile, automated
    ecosystems. From container orchestration at scale to low-level networking and embedded systems, I enjoy working with
    diverse teams to tackle problems at every layer of the stack. This breadth lets me craft well-rounded solutions that
    meld speed, resilience, and security with ease of use.

      Routine contributor to the Gentoo Linux project, a source-based Linux distribution with a focus on flexibility and
      customization. Normal contributions include assisting the community troubleshoot package build failures via
      IRC and email, triaging bugs found in my weekly builds of the Gentoo tree (covering approximately 8,000 packages
      on amd64, arm64), and testing patches for project maintainers.
